## React application developed while taking the React JS Fundamentals course on https://online.reacttraining.com.

This repo contains the work I made while following the React JS Fundamentals Course on https://online.reacttraining.com by Tyler McGinnis.

It mainly covers the basics of React:

- How to create components
- Props
- State
- A component's lifecycle
- NPM, Babel, Webpack 
- React Router
- Stateless functional components
- Conditional Rendering
- Axios
- Promises 
- Container vs presentational components
